# Creating Symmetry
This program lets you transform an image into an image with symmetrical pattern. Just supply a base image and a formula to get started.

![Image with 7 horizontal stripes creating the rainbow with white on top and black on the bottom. Rainbow Stripe](example/rainbow_stripe.png)

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rosette with 3 rotational symmetry](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_1.png)
![Transformed rainbow stripe image into frieze with p11g symmetry, with blue and yellow hourglasses in a green background](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p11m_and_p11g.png)
![Transformed rainbow stripe image into hexagonal lattice with p31m symmetry, with purple, indigo and blue nodes against a transparent background](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_hexagonal_p31m.png)

I assume you're comfortable with [Go](https://golang.org/), YAML and a command line. You'll install this in Go, write the formulas in YAML, and run `make run` on a command line to generate pretty patterns.

## Installation
This program is written in [Go](https://golang.org/), so download that first.

Once that is done, you can use go to get this project for you:
`go get https://github.com/chadius/creatingsymmetry/`

You will need a source image. [A rainbow stripe pattern is included](example/rainbow_stripe.png) in this repository and used throughout these docs.

### Manual Install using go install
If `go get` doesn't work you can check out this repository directly. Then open a terminal and navigate to the folder this code lies in.

Run `go install` and it will download the other required libraries:
- yaml
- ginkgo
- gomega
- check

## How to run

Copy the example formula, and run the program.

```shell script
cp data/oldformula.yml.example data/oldformula.yml
make run
```

When you run `make run`, it will generate this [orange and red rosette pattern](#rosette):

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rosette with 3 rotational symmetry, creating three yellow to purple petals on a orange and red striped background](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_1.png)

You can open `out/example_image.png` to see the results. (on a Mac, you can also type `open out/example_image.png` to open it in Preview.)

### What happened?
This program needs answers to these questions:
- What image do you want to transform?
- How do you want to transform the image?
- Where is the result stored?

`make run` expands into this command:
- `go run main.go -in example/rainbow_stripe.png -f data/formula.yml -out out/example_image.png`

And follows these steps:
- Transform this image: `example/rainbow_stripe.png`
- Transform it with these instructions: `data/formula.yml`
- Store the result in this image: `out/example_image.png`.

## Command Line Options
```
  -source, -in
        Source filename, the image you want to transform.
  -out
        Output filename, where the result is stored.
  -size
        Output resolution, the size of the final image.
  -f, -formula
    	The filename of the formula file. Defaults to ./data/formula.yml (default "formula")
```

### Source Filename
The name of the image file. JPG and PNG are supported, as well as any format Go langâ€™s `Image` library supports.

Examples:
- `-source example/rainbow_stripe.png`
- `-in input/iceCreamSundae.jpg`

### Output Filename
The name of the output filename. All output files are in PNG format.

`-out ouput/rainbow_stripe_frieze.png`

#### Output Resolution
How big do you want the resulting image?
- Bigger images give more detail.
- Smaller images render faster.

Supply a pair of integers, separated with a single x.

Examples:
`-size 200x200`
`-size 300x50`

## Types of patterns
### Rosette
**Rosette** patterns surround the center of the image, expanding outward. They can be rotated around the center without visually changing the look. 

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rosette with 3 rotational symmetry, creating three yellow to purple petals on a orange and red striped background](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_1.png)

[3 way rotational symmetry](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_1.yml)

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rosette with 4 rotational symmetry, creating purple and green petals on a blue background](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_2.png)

[4 way rotational symmetry](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_2.yml)

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rosette with 5 rotational symmetry, creating a 10 point mostly green hubcap](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_3.png)

[5 way rotational symmetry](example/rosettes/rainbow_stripe_rosette_3.yml)

[Click here](docs/pattern_rosette.md) to learn more about rosette-based patterns and design your own.

### Frieze
**Frieze** patterns expand horizontally forever but usually have a finite height.

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into frieze with p11g symmetry, with blue and yellow hourglasses in a green background](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p11m_and_p11g.png)

[Reflective symmetry across the x-axis](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p11m_and_p11g.yml)

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into frieze with p2111 symmetry, like an orange branch with black notches separated by blue and white droplets](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p211.png)

[2 way Rotational symmetry](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p211.yml)

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into frieze with p2mg symmetry, with multicolored spikes emerging from a green background](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p2mg.png)

[Glide symmetry: move the pattern horizontally a bit and then flip it over the x-axis](example/friezes/rainbow_stripe_frieze_p2mg.yml)

[Click here](docs/pattern_frieze.md) to learn more about frieze-based patterns and how to build your own.

### Lattice
**Lattice** patterns transform using a 4 sided shape called a lattice. They expand horizontally and vertically forever. Sometimes these are called wallpaper patterns.

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rectangular lattice with pmg symmetry, with green and orange round rectangules on a yellow background](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rectangular_pmg.png)

[Rectangular lattice](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rectangular_pmg.yml).
The lattice connects the 4 centers of the green and orange ovals. Then the lattice is repeated to create the image.

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into hexagonal lattice with p31m symmetry, with purple, indigo and blue nodes against a transparent background](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_hexagonal_p31m.png)

[Hexagonal lattice](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_hexagonal_p31m.yml)
Creates 3 way rotational symmetry. This lattice can be stacked 7 times to create a hexagonal pattern. Count the solid blue dots to see the corners of the lattices.

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rhombic lattice with cmm symmetry. Red and orange blobs sit interlocked against a transparent background](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rhombic_cmm.png)

[Rhombic lattice](example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rhombic_cmm.yml)
The lattice is based on a rhombus, where all sides are the same length but not at a square.
All red blobs should look the same, but due to the low resolution rounding errors appear.

[Click here](docs/pattern_lattice.md) to learn more about lattice-based patterns. (Still a Work In Progress!)

## How to test
If you plan to mess around with the code itself, here are 2 more make commands that will come in handy:
- `make test` Runs the unit tests.
- `make lint` Runs the linter and formats files.
