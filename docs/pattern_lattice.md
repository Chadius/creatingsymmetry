**Lattice** patterns tend to repeat using a given 4 sided shape called a lattice. They expand horizontally and vertically.

Rectangular lattice with pmg symmetry [(link to formula)](../example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rectangular_pmg.yml).
There is a lattice that connects the centers of 4 orange and green rectangles. The lattice is stacked throughout the pattern to make it repeat.

The four sided lattice is tilted, so look for the solid blue points and you may see it. Stacked enough times it connects 7 of them.

![Transformed rainbow stripe image into rhombic lattice with cmm symmetry. Red and orange blobs sit interlocked against a transparent background](../example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rhombic_cmm.png)

Rhombic lattice with cmm symmetry [(link to formula)](../example/lattices/rainbow_stripe_lattice_rhombic_cmm.yml)
The lattice is based on a rhombus, where all sides are the same length but not at a square. There are rounding errors since the resolution is so small, but all of the red shapes should be exactly the same.
