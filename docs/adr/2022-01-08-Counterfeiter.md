# Why
Dependency Injection requires my to make fake objects that conform to an interface.
I have to manually write out that interface and maintain it when I write interfaces.
This is tedious and discourages me from writing good tests.

# What is it
https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter

counterfeiter is a 3rd party tool that generates fake objects for me.

# What will this look like once it's complete?
Tests no longer have to make mock objects.

# Caveats and warnings
If counterfeiter becomes obsolete, I'll have to find an alternative tool.
