# Why
Separate the image processing from command generation.

# What is it
Make a new project that will send commands to this project.
This project will have a package function that accepts the command and uses it to make the image.
This project will send the image to the new project.
The new project will save the image.

# What can happen next
Since we accept JSON/YAML, a web server can send the command to this package.
